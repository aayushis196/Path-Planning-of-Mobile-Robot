# Path-Planning-of-Mobile-Robot

This project reviews various path following and trajectory
tracking methods to track a reference point on the
path which represents the rate of change of parameter of the
trajectory. The aim is to minimize the euclidean distance between
the vehicle and above mentioned reference point. Moreover the
other concerns would be to reduce the cross-track error and the
heading error. The methods like pure pursuit and its variations
are described. The Stanley method of path following and other
trajectory tracking methods like control Lyapunov Based Design
and its modifications are analyzed. This paper has also looked into
MPC(Model Predictive Control) and its variations for applying
it to trajectory tracking. Simulations were done on kinematic
model of car in MATLAB to find the best method to achieve the
objective.
